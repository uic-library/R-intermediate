-------------------------------------------
This workshop helps attendees understand the functions which are already present in R and also how someone can define their own function. Next it covers how to visualize data (create charts) for various data types. Finally, hypothesis testing will be covered which helps one identify patterns in the data. 

Additionally, in a second paragraph, please mention the data set or materials that will be used in the workshop and briefly describe them. Also, briefly describe some of the things that will be done with the data/materials in the workshop, "i.e. load data into Jupyter Notebook and create basic data visualizations showing the relationship between [variable 1] and [variable 2].

{% comment %} briefly list workshop goals below - should be the same as the objectives from each workshop section (also repeated in the workshop overview) {% endcomment %}

## Workshop goals
- Learn about built-in functions and how to create your own in R
- Learn about data visualization in R
