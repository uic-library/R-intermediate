Hypothesis  testing  is  performed to  identify  if  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  attributes (columns)  of  our  data  set.  Hypothesis testing  is  only  used  to  confirm  that  there  is  a  relation between the attributes considered but does not define the nature of the relationship.

To perform hypothesis testing, we first initially form 2 different hypotheses:•Null Hypothesis–No difference between data considered•Alternate Hypothesis–There is a difference between the data considered For example, if we want to perform a hypothesis testing to check if a car’s transmission type (Manual or Automatic) has an impact on the price of a car then our hypothesis would be:•Null Hypothesis–There is no difference in the price range of a car based on itsNull Hypothesis–type of transmission•Alternate Hypothesis–There is a statistical difference in the price range of a car basedAlternate Hypothesis–on its type of transmissionKindly find a video explaining hypothesis testing in more detail here.CONFIDENCE INTERVALThe confidence interval determines the range of values which the true mean lies. For example, if data is collected regarding the height of men then, a 95% confidence interval provides the range of height within which the true mean of all men’s height lie.
